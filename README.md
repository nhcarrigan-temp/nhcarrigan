# NHCarrigan

We are a software consultancy and community management firm.

We have two very specific missions:

- Help start-up companies reach their goals
- Help developers break in to the tech industry

We are currently a sole-proprietorship, but we have big plans to expand into an LLC and to hire developers who are in need of their first tech opportunity.
